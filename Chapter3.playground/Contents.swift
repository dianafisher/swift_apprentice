 ## Challenges
 ### Challenge 1
 Whatâ€™s wrong with the following code?
 
 ```
 let firstName = "Matt"
 
 if firstName == "Matt" {
 let lastName = "Galloway"
 } else if firstName == "Ray" {
 let lastName = "Wenderlich"
 }
 let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName
 ```

 ### Challenge 3
 Squares on a chessboard numbered left to right, top to bottom.
 0 is top-left square.  63 is bottom-right square.
 Rows numbered 0 to 7
 Cols numbered 0 to 7

 ### Challenge 4
 
 Given the coefficients a, b and c, calculate the solutions to a quadratic equation with these coefficients. Take into account the different number of solutions (0, 1 or 2). If you need a math refresher, this Wikipedia article on the quadratic equation will help

/*:
 ### Challenge 5
 
 Given a month (represented with a String in all lowercase) and the current year (represented with an Int), calculate the number of days in the month.

 ### Challenge 6
 Given a number, determine if this number is a power of 2. (Hint: you can use log2(number) to find the base 2 logarithm of number. log2(number) will return a whole number if number is a power of two. You can also solve the problem using a loop and no logarithm.)
