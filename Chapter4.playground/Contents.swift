// Can use pattern matching as cases...

    print("Even")
default:
    print("Odd")
}

// Can also use the underscore character to ignore x since it is not needed
switch number {
case _ where number % 2 == 0:
    print("Even")
default:
    print("Odd")
}

// Partial matching..

 ### 1. Write a switch statement that takes an age as an integer and prints out the life stage related to that age. You can make up the life stages, or use my categorization as follows: 0-2 years, Infant; 3-12 years, Child; 13-19 years, Teenager; 20-39, Adult; 40-60, Middle aged; 61+, Elderly.

default:

/*:
 ### 2. Write a switch statement that takes a tuple containing a string and an integer. The string is a name, and the integer is an age. Use the same cases that you used in the previous exercise and let syntax to print out the name followed by the life stage. For example, for myself it would print out "Matt is an adult.".

     var sum = 0
     for i in 0...5 {

     }
